RTFM


help()  <----the first line of defense

help(something goes here)


help(math) <---for example

DON'T FORGET TO IMPORT MATH FIRST, but this works for libraries that are already loaded as well

help(len)
help(iter)
help(askldjalsjdlakjsdkljasd) 

help() will tell you what parameters a built in function or module needs 

For example, help(all) will return that it needs a boolean value, whereas help(raw_input) will return that it needs a string






if you get a 'not defined' error, this means you probably need to import something first

Or that you spelled something wrong

q exits the help text, you can navigate with the arrow keys or hjkl (if you're super cool)



====================================================

If the built in help does not answer your question, check out the Python.org documentation HERE:

https://docs.python.org/2 <----this covers the version we're using for the class, in the upper left hand corner, you'll see that you can toggle which version of Python you're using 

(YOU CAN CHECK WHICH VERSION IS RUNNING BY USING "python --version" at the shell)

This site has a handy tutorial that starts with the basics and works through the vast majority of built-in Python "stuff"



And finally, if you aren't able to find the help you need
